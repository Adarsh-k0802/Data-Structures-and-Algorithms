<h2>Applications of Recursion:<h2>
<br />

1. Many algorithm techniques are based on recursion
   - Dynamic Programming
   - Backtracting
   - Divide and Conquer (Binary Search, Quick sort, Merge sort)
2. Many problems are inherently recursive
   - Tower of Hanoi
   - DFS based traversal (DFS of Graph and Inorder/Preorder/Postorder traversal of tree)
